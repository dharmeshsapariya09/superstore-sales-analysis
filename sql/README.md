🧠 Customer Segmentation Using RFM Model

To better understand customer behavior, an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis was performed.

🔹 RFM Methodology

Recency (R): Number of days since last purchase

Frequency (F): Total number of orders

Monetary (M): Total profit generated

Customers were scored using NTILE(5) for each metric:

Lower recency → Higher score

Higher frequency → Higher score

Higher monetary value → Higher score

Final RFM Score = R + F + M (Range: 3–15)
